I decided to move the HackerBot website here because I wanted the ability to section things off on seperate sub-pages which is something I cannot do with GitHub Pages.  
  
  
  
Be sure you type `npm install --save discord.js opusscript ytdl-core request fs get-youtube-id youtube-info ffmpeg-binaries` before trying to run the bot
