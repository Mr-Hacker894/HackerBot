# The HackerBot website has moved :)
[HackerBot Website](https://sites.google.com/view/hackerbot/home)  
[HackerBot Music Website](https://sites.google.com/view/hackerbot-music/home)  
[Dev Page](https://sites.google.com/view/mrhacker-dev-page/home)   
I decided to move the HackerBot website here because I wanted the ability to section things off on seperate sub-pages which is something I cannot do with GitHub Pages.
