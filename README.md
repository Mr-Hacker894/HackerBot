This bot was made for running with Node.js and built off of Discord.js.  

This bot was also ran on macOS (if that is important to anyone), but can run on Windows or Linux.

The HackerWorld version of HackerBot is 0.0.9 . That version uses > as its prefix.  

This change was made due to interferance with popular bots like GalacticBot.
