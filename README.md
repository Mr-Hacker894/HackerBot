# HackerBot  

HackerBot was (at first) made for the HackerWorld Discord. But after some users were excited about adding this bot to their own server it was decided that HackerBot would release to the public with its source code being released to GitHub. HackerBot runs off of the Discord.JS API for an easy server and client-side experience.  

# Future  
  
  For HackerBot 0.2 The Overhaul will redesign quite a few of the commands. For example Help will only show commands available to certain roles. We hope you all stick around for v0.2 of HackerBot to see the new editions we make.

# Features  

HackerBot v0.1 (Releasing Saturday)  

-Moderation 
 HackerBot will delete messages with cuss words and _other_ inappropriate content.

-Embedded Help Messages  
 HackerBot's Help Messages will be DM'd to the user and are embedded so they do not clutter server chats and are easier to read.

-Ban, Kicking, and Purging Locked to Certain Roles  
 HackerBot will not let users without an Owner, Admin, or Moderator role use the Ban, Kick, or Purge command(s) so you don't have to worry about Raids and Trolls.
